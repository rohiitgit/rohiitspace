# LinkedIn Image Hotlink Protection Issue ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem (FIXED)
The achievement image from LinkedIn was not displaying on the website due to hotlink protection.

**Image URL:**
```
https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFtlSU8SO8orw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZPPaQa5G8As-/0/1734351591846?e=1761177600&v=beta&t=W_5AxIVXytuX9V5mwq_3mK0iSAyzIR1s_BY0g2QccTU
```

## Root Cause
LinkedIn blocks direct image hotlinking from external websites:
- Returns **403 Forbidden** when accessed from your portfolio site
- LinkedIn's CDN has hotlink protection/referrer checks
- The URL may also have expired (note the `e=1761177600` expiry parameter)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Download and Self-Host (RECOMMENDED)
Download the image and host it in your repository:

```bash
# Download the image (you'll need to do this while logged into LinkedIn)
# Save it to: public/assets/images/sih-2024-certificate.jpg

# Then update content.js:
image: "assets/images/sih-2024-certificate.jpg",
```

**Steps:**
1. Open the LinkedIn post in your browser (while logged in)
2. Right-click the image → "Save Image As..."
3. Save to `/home/rohit/Public/rohiitspace/public/assets/images/`
4. Update the image path in `content.js`

### Option 2: Use Imgur or Another Image Host
Upload to a reliable image hosting service:
- [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) - Free, reliable
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) - Professional CDN
- GitHub - Store in repo and use raw.githubusercontent.com URL

### Option 3: Leave As-Is (Current Behavior)
The code now shows a graceful fallback message:
> "Image unavailable (LinkedIn hotlink protection)"

## Current Implementation
The code now includes:
- ✅ URL validation before rendering
- ✅ Graceful error handling with `onerror`
- ✅ User-friendly fallback message
- ✅ Console error logging for debugging

## Resolution ✅

**FIXED:** Image has been downloaded and self-hosted!

**File location:** `/public/assets/images/sih.webp` (176KB)

**Updated in:** [content.js:152](public/src/scripts/content.js#L152)
```javascript
image: "assets/images/sih.webp",
```

### Benefits of Self-Hosting:
- ✅ Image always loads reliably
- ✅ Faster load times (no external request)
- ✅ No LinkedIn dependencies or expiry issues
- ✅ Complete control over the asset
- ✅ WebP format for optimal file size
