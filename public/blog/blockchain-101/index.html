                <h2>welcome to blockchain 101.</h2>

                <p>i bet you have a lot of questions going on, let us start with the most common one:</p>

                <blockquote>
                <p><strong>"what is blockchain and why do i keep hearing about it on the internet so much?"</strong></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>i bet you've asked this yourself a lot of times, if not then it's time you do.</p>

                <p>a blockchain is as simple as its name suggests. it is a <strong>chain of blocks</strong>.</p>

                <p><em>"blocks of what?"</em></p>

                <p>blocks of data that <strong>can not be changed</strong>. yes, it fails all your erasers and backspaces. once a block is written it can't be altered, fixed, or deleted.</p>

                <h2>🔗 how does blockchain work?</h2>

                <p>imagine you're in a classroom taking a test. every time someone completes a question, they announce it to the entire class. everyone writes down what that person answered.</p>

                <p>now, if someone tries to change their answer later, everyone else will notice because they all have the original answer written down. that person will be called a cheater and their new answer will be rejected.</p>

                <p>this is exactly how blockchain works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>when a new block is created, it's broadcast to thousands of computers worldwide</li>
                    <li>everyone gets a notification and saves a copy</li>
                    <li>if someone tries to modify a block later, the network rejects it as "cheating"</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>🌐 what makes blockchain special?</h2>

                <h3>decentralized</h3>
                <p>no single person, company, or government controls it. it's maintained by thousands of computers working together.</p>

                <h3>transparent</h3>
                <p>every action is visible to everyone in the network. there are no hidden transactions or secret changes.</p>

                <h3>secure</h3>
                <p>because everyone has a copy and is watching, it's extremely difficult to manipulate or hack.</p>

                <h2>💰 practical example: cryptocurrency</h2>

                <p>blockchain enables a new type of digital money called cryptocurrency. unlike traditional money controlled by governments and banks, cryptocurrencies are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>impossible to manipulate</strong> - every transaction is recorded and verified</li>
                    <li><strong>globally accessible</strong> - works the same everywhere in the world</li>
                    <li><strong>transparent</strong> - anyone can verify transactions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>when you send cryptocurrency to someone, that transaction becomes a new block. the entire network verifies it's legitimate before adding it to the chain permanently.</p>

                <h2>🚀 why does this matter?</h2>

                <p>blockchain is revolutionizing how we think about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>digital ownership and assets</li>
                    <li>financial transactions without middlemen</li>
                    <li>transparent and trustworthy record-keeping</li>
                    <li>global systems that work without central control</li>
                </ul>

                <p>this technology is still in its early stages, but it's already changing industries from finance to healthcare to supply chain management.</p>

                <p>next up: cryptocurrency 101 - how digital money actually works and why it's more than just "internet money."</p>
